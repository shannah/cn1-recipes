== Platform-Specific Font Scaling

[discrete]
=== Problem

Your app looks great except that on desktop, the fonts are a little too small.  If you could only scale the fonts to be 25% larger on the desktop, your app would be perfect.

=== Solution

You can use font-scaling constants to scale all of the fonts in your stylesheet by a constant factor.  You can use a "media-query-like" syntax to apply this scaling only on particular platforms, devices, or densities.

.Example: Scaling Fonts to be 25% larger on desktop
[source,css]
----
#Constants {
    device-desktop-font-scale: "1.25";
}
----

TIP: In most cases it is better to use standard media queries to apply styles which target specific platforms in a more fine-grained manner.
