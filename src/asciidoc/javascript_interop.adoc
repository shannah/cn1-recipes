== Sending Messages to Outside Webpage

[discrete]
=== Problem

You need to communicate back and forth between the Codename One app and the webpage that contains it.

=== Solution

There are two sides to this problem:

. Sending messages from Codename One to the outside webpage.
. Sending messages form the Outside webpage to Codename One.

For the first case (sending messages to the outside webpage), you can use `CN.postMessage()`, in Codename One to send the message.  The message will be dispatched to Javascript event listeners in the outside webpage that register to receive 'cn1outbox' events.

.Sending a message from Codename One to the outside webpage.
[source,java]
----
MessageEvent message = new MessageEvent(
    null,        // event source... we'll leave it null
    "Hello",     // The message to deliver
    0            // Optional message code.  
);
//Dispatch the message
CN.postMessage(message);

    var message = evt.detail;
    var code = evt.code;
    ...
});
